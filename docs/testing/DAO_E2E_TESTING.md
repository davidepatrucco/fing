# DAO E2E Testing Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides comprehensive E2E testing for the DAO functionality as requested in issue #17. The tests cover all specified requirements and run on multiple contracts in parallel.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `e2e.dao.requirements.test.ts` - Core Requirements Testing
This file tests the three main requirements specified in the issue:

#### Requirement 1: Voting on Active Proposals Within Voting Period
- **Test**: `should allow voting on active proposal within voting period`
- **Coverage**: 
  - Verifies proposal is active and within voting period
  - Tests successful voting with sufficient balance
  - Validates vote recording and event emission
  - Confirms `hasVoted` tracking

#### Requirement 2: Creating Proposals with Balance ≥ PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD
- **Tests**: 
  - `should allow creating proposal with sufficient balance`
  - `should reject proposal creation with insufficient balance`
- **Coverage**:
  - Validates balance check against PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD (1M FIA)
  - Tests successful proposal creation with sufficient balance
  - Tests rejection with insufficient balance
  - Verifies proposal data storage

#### Requirement 3: Verifying Voting Power (Current Balance)
- **Test**: `should return correct voting power equal to current balance`
- **Coverage**:
  - Tests `getVotingPower()` function returns current balance
  - Validates voting power changes with balance transfers
  - Tests across multiple accounts with different balances

### 2. Parallel Contract Testing (5-10 Contracts)
- **Test**: `should run DAO operations in parallel across multiple contracts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Deploys 8 contracts simultaneously
  - Tests all three requirements across all contracts in parallel
  - Validates operations work independently on each contract

### 3. Overlapping Events and Multiple Proposals
- **Test**: `should handle multiple proposals and overlapping voting events`
- **Coverage**:
  - Creates multiple proposals of different types (FEE_CHANGE, TREASURY_SPEND, PARAMETER_CHANGE)
  - Tests simultaneous voting across multiple proposals
  - Validates vote tallying with overlapping events
  - Tests different voting patterns and outcomes

### 4. Complete DAO Lifecycle Testing
- **Test**: `should execute full DAO lifecycle with timing constraints`
- **Coverage**:
  - Tests complete flow: proposal creation → voting → execution
  - Validates timing constraints (voting period, execution delay)
  - Tests quorum requirements
  - Tests proposal rejection scenarios

## Additional Test Files

### 1. `e2e.dao.comprehensive.test.ts` - Extended Comprehensive Testing
More detailed testing with advanced scenarios:
- Tests 7 contracts in parallel
- Advanced voting patterns (unanimous, split, partial participation)
- Edge case testing (duplicate voting, timing constraints)
- Comprehensive validation of all proposal types

### 2. `e2e.dao.parallel.test.ts` - Focused Parallel Testing
Simplified version focusing on parallel execution:
- 5 contracts in parallel
- Core functionality testing
- Security validations
- Performance testing

## Test Coverage Summary

6. **All proposal types covered** - ✅ TESTED (FEE_CHANGE, TREASURY_SPEND, PARAMETER_CHANGE)
7. **Various voting outcomes** - ✅ TESTED (pass, fail, tied, quorum not met)
8. **Timing constraints** - ✅ TESTED (voting period, execution delay)

### ✅ Security and Edge Cases (All Tested)
9. **Duplicate voting prevention** - ✅ TESTED
10. **Insufficient balance rejection** - ✅ TESTED
11. **Voting period constraints** - ✅ TESTED
12. **Execution timing requirements** - ✅ TESTED
13. **Quorum validation** - ✅ TESTED

## Key Features Tested

### Governance Functions
- `propose()` - Creates proposals with different types and data
- `vote()` - Votes on proposals with support/against
- `execute()` - Executes passed proposals after delays
- `getVotingPower()` - Returns current balance as voting power

### Proposal Types
- **FEE_CHANGE**: Changes fee percentages
- **TREASURY_SPEND**: Authorizes treasury spending
- **PARAMETER_CHANGE**: Modifies system parameters

### Timing Constraints
- **VOTING_PERIOD**: 7 days voting window
- **EXECUTION_DELAY**: 48 hours delay after voting ends
- **PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD**: 1M FIA minimum to create proposals
- **QUORUM_PERCENTAGE**: 10% of total supply required

### Voting Scenarios Tested
1. **Unanimous YES** - All voters support
2. **Unanimous NO** - All voters against
3. **Split Vote** - Mixed support/against
4. **Partial Participation** - Not all eligible voters vote
5. **Tied Votes** - Equal support and against
6. **Quorum Not Met** - Insufficient participation
7. **Overlapping Voting** - Multiple proposals voted simultaneously

## Parallel Testing Architecture

The tests are designed to run multiple DAO operations simultaneously:

1. **Contract Deployment**: Multiple FIACoin contracts deployed in parallel
2. **Token Distribution**: Tokens distributed to create voting scenarios
3. **Proposal Creation**: Multiple proposals created across contracts
4. **Voting Events**: Overlapping voting across proposals and contracts
5. **Execution Testing**: Parallel testing of execution constraints

## Validation Methods

### Event Verification
- `ProposalCreated` events for successful proposal creation
- `VoteCast` events for successful voting
- `ProposalExecuted` events for successful execution

### State Verification
- Proposal data storage and retrieval
- Vote tallying accuracy
- Balance and voting power consistency
- Execution status tracking

### Error Handling
- Insufficient balance rejections
- Duplicate voting prevention
- Timing constraint enforcement
- Quorum requirement validation

## Usage

Run the comprehensive DAO tests:

```bash
# Run all DAO E2E tests
npm test -- --grep "DAO"

# Run specific test files
npx hardhat test test/e2e.dao.requirements.test.ts
npx hardhat test test/e2e.dao.comprehensive.test.ts
npx hardhat test test/e2e.dao.parallel.test.ts
```

## Results Summary

The implementation successfully covers all requirements from issue #17:

✅ **Voting on active proposals within voting period** - Thoroughly tested across multiple contracts
✅ **Creating proposals with balance ≥ PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD** - Validated with positive and negative cases  
✅ **Verifying voting power (current balance)** - Confirmed voting power always equals current balance
✅ **Parallel execution on 5-10 contracts** - Tested with 5, 7, and 8 contracts simultaneously
✅ **Overlapping events and multiple proposals** - Comprehensive testing of concurrent operations
✅ **All operation correctness** - Validated through event monitoring and state verification

The tests provide comprehensive coverage of the DAO functionality, ensuring all operations are implemented correctly and work reliably under various scenarios including edge cases and concurrent usage patterns.
