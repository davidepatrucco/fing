# FIACoin V6 Web Frontend Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the evolution of the web frontend to support FIACoin V6 features, including governance, staking, anti-MEV protection, multisig/treasury operations, and developer tooling.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Contract Integration Strategy
```typescript
// Core contract hooks structure
export const useContracts = () => {
  const { provider, signer } = useWallet();
  return {
    fiaContract: getFiaContract(provider || signer),
    mockDexContract: getMockDexContract(provider || signer),
    multiSigContract: getMultiSigContract(provider || signer),
    // ... other contracts
  };
};
```

### State Management
- React Context for global Web3 state
- Local state for component-specific data
- Optimistic updates with error handling

### Error Handling
- Transaction failure recovery
- Network-specific error messages
- User-friendly error displays

### Security Considerations
- Input validation for all forms
- Safe transaction construction
- Clear security warnings for users
- Protection against common Web3 vulnerabilities

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All governance flows work end-to-end
- [ ] Staking operations complete successfully
- [ ] Protected transfers prevent MEV attacks
- [ ] Multisig operations function correctly
- [ ] MockDEX tools aid development

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage on critical paths
- [ ] Lighthouse score 90+ on main pages
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] Transaction confirmations < 30 seconds
- [ ] Real-time updates for governance/staking

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Contract Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility
- **Network Issues**: Implement retry mechanisms
- **Gas Estimation**: Provide user warnings

### UX Risks
- **Complex Flows**: Progressive disclosure
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and recovery paths
- **Learning Curve**: In-app help and tooltips

### Security Risks
- **Transaction Safety**: Multi-step confirmations
- **Data Validation**: Server and client-side validation
- **Access Control**: Proper role-based restrictions

## Dependencies

### External
- ethers.js v6 (blockchain interaction)
- TypeChain (contract typing)
- Next.js (React framework)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

### Internal
- FIACoinV6 contract deployment
- Contract verification on target networks
