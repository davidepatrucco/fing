 * @title FIACoin v3
 * @dev ERC20 token with transfer fees and burn mechanism
 * @notice This token implements a fee system on transfers with three destinations:
 *         - Treasury: operational funds
 *         - Founder: team allocation  
 *         - Burn: deflationary mechanism
 * 
 * SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * ‚úÖ Uses OpenZeppelin battle-tested contracts
 * ‚úÖ Fee exemption system for DEX compatibility
 * ‚úÖ Maximum fee cap protection (2%)
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è  Fee logic in _update can be gas expensive
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è  Multiple transfers per transaction increase complexity

    /**
     * @notice Core transfer function with fee logic
     * @param from Sender address
     * @param to Recipient address  
     * @param value Amount to transfer
     * @dev Overrides OpenZeppelin's _update to implement fee system
     * 
     * TRANSFER FLOW:
     * 1. Check if fees should be applied (exemptions, zero addresses, zero fees)
     * 2. If no fees: execute normal transfer + emit Fingered event
     * 3. If fees apply: calculate fee distributions and execute multiple transfers
     * 
     * FEE CALCULATION:
     * - Total Fee: (value * totalFeeBP) / 10,000
     * - Treasury: (feeAmount * feeToTreasuryBP) / totalFeeBP  
     * - Founder: (feeAmount * feeToFounderBP) / totalFeeBP
     * - Burn: (feeAmount * feeToBurnBP) / totalFeeBP
     * - User receives: value - feeAmount
     * 
     * SECURITY ANALYSIS:
     * ‚úÖ Proper exemption logic for minting/burning
     * ‚úÖ Fee calculations use safe math (no overflow in modern Solidity)
     * ‚úÖ Burns happen after transfers to prevent balance issues
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è  Multiple transfers increase gas cost significantly  
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è  No validation that fee percentages sum to totalFeeBP
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è  Potential for rounding errors in fee distribution
     * 
     * GAS OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
     * - Batch multiple transfers in single operation
     * - Pre-calculate fee amounts to avoid repeated calculations
     * - Consider using assembly for gas savings
     * 
     * POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES:
     * - Fee-on-transfer tokens can break DEX integrations if not handled properly
     * - Multiple _update calls could theoretically trigger reentrancy (mitigated by ERC20 design)
     * - Rounding down in fee calculations could lead to dust accumulation
