@notice Core transfer function with fee logic\n @param from Sender address\n @param to Recipient address  \n @param value Amount to transfer\n @dev Overrides OpenZeppelin's _update to implement fee system\n \n TRANSFER FLOW:\n 1. Check if fees should be applied (exemptions, zero addresses, zero fees)\n 2. If no fees: execute normal transfer + emit Fingered event\n 3. If fees apply: calculate fee distributions and execute multiple transfers\n \n FEE CALCULATION:\n - Total Fee: (value * totalFeeBP) / 10,000\n - Treasury: (feeAmount * feeToTreasuryBP) / totalFeeBP  \n - Founder: (feeAmount * feeToFounderBP) / totalFeeBP\n - Burn: (feeAmount * feeToBurnBP) / totalFeeBP\n - User receives: value - feeAmount\n \n SECURITY ANALYSIS:\n ✅ Proper exemption logic for minting/burning\n ✅ Fee calculations use safe math (no overflow in modern Solidity)\n ✅ Burns happen after transfers to prevent balance issues\n ⚠️  Multiple transfers increase gas cost significantly  \n ⚠️  No validation that fee percentages sum to totalFeeBP\n ⚠️  Potential for rounding errors in fee distribution\n \n GAS OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:\n - Batch multiple transfers in single operation\n - Pre-calculate fee amounts to avoid repeated calculations\n - Consider using assembly for gas savings\n \n POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES:\n - Fee-on-transfer tokens can break DEX integrations if not handled properly\n - Multiple _update calls could theoretically trigger reentrancy (mitigated by ERC20 design)\n - Rounding down in fee calculations could lead to dust
